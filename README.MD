# Steam Shortcut Manager++

This is a tool that adds non-steam shortcuts by reading from manifest files that contain information about the game. The manifest files contain the game name, executable, command line arguments, and any images.

I created this application because there aren't any quick and easy ways of adding a huge batch of games to the steam deck at once. I don't want to manually add every single .exe game, it was already tedious enough to do it on my PC.

Essentially, you should be able to place all the artwork inside the game folder, then write a manifest file. Or perhaps skip writing the manifest file entirely and just specify the game folder, or an appid.txt...

# TODO

- Ability to add games automatically without a manifest file, maybe by automatically searching for `steam_hero.png`, `steam_banner.png`, etc

- Ability to set proton config.

- Ability to set keyboard and controller bindings. Ideally like how the official steam manifests work.

- Ability to remove games using the manifests.

- Installation to /bin/games so you can double click a .smanifest to immediately add it to steam. Although this wouldn't work on the steam deck, so maybe the shebang has to be changed.

- Fixing icons. This is not really a priority though, since the steam deck doesn't use them.

# Getting Started

For each game you want to add, you have to write a manifest file.

Refer to sample.manifest for examples. Key names are case insensitive.

After writing your manifest, you can do `python3 MyGame.smanifest`, it will add the steam shortcut and images to every steam account that exists.


# Documentation

If you're just here because you're interested in how Steam shortcuts and steam:// links are stored/generated, look [here](https://github.com/CorporalQuesadilla/Steam-Shortcut-Manager/wiki/Steam-Shortcuts-Documentation) for documentation.

If you're here for documentation on how this program works, continue reading.

Please note that there are some differences in the arguments my program expects vs. how Steam actually stores shortcuts - the documentation below is simply for the "easy" input my program can be given in order to generate the funky input that Steam actually needs. This prevents the user from worrying about funky ASCII characters or quote encapsulation. It's much easier to type 0 than (insert series of invisible characters here).

# How it works

I simply modify shortcuts.vdf based on what I've seen in other entries generated by Steam itself. You can read more here: https://github.com/CorporalQuesadilla/Steam-Shortcut-Manager/wiki/Steam-Shortcuts-Documentation

As for the steam:// ID generation, see the comment used in the excerpt of Scott Rice's code in shortcuts.py in the GetURL() function.

# Future Roadmap

In no particular order:
* Further document attributes I don't understand (time played, shortcut path) and what values are accepted/how they're interpreted.
* Support users who don't have an existing shortcuts.vdf (should be simple to create a new one)
* Test to make sure this works on Linux/Mac (or have other users confirm). I don't see why it wouldn't work, though.
* Detect broken files or other malformed data to prevent making issues worse. This also includes the ability to recognize any new attributes Steam may have added so that I don't break the entire file by creating entries with missing attributes.
* Further documentation on what acceptable values for attributes are. (i.e. can stuff be missing, etc.)
* Friendlier "experience" - stop asking for things everyone leaves blank by default, like last played date. Accept having no tags. Automatically determine "starting path" from path to executable.
* Ability to remove shortcuts (perhaps based on id or appname?)

# Acknowledgments

* Scott Rice for ICE, or rather his work finding how steam:// IDs are generated.
* PsychoTheHedgehog for also documenting how shortcuts.vdf is laid out. Unfortunately, their work was trashed some time ago and the Google cached version dissappeared sometime in July 2018. It turns out they had discovered essentially the same things I had, but at least it's reassuring to find someone else had documented almost the exact the same things. Their documentation was fairly old (missing some variables added in recent years) and I wasn't a fan of how it was explained anyways, but hey, credit to them for independently finding the same things first. Hopefully my documentation here will remain updated and accessible, as it seems to be the only documentation publicly available now.
